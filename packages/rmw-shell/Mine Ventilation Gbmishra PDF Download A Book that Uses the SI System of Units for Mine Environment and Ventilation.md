Mine ventilation is the process of supplying fresh air and removing contaminated air from underground mines. It is essential for the safety, health and productivity of miners and the environment. Mine ventilation also helps to control the temperature, humidity, dust, gas and fire hazards in the mine.
 
One of the most authoritative and comprehensive books on mine ventilation is *Mine Environment and Ventilation* by G.B. Mishra. This book was first published in 1986 by Oxford University Press and has been revised and enlarged in its second edition. It is designed both for students of mining engineering and practicing engineers who want to learn the principles and applications of mine ventilation.

The book covers various topics related to mine ventilation, such as:
 
- The properties and behavior of air and gases in mines
- The methods of measuring and analyzing airflow, pressure, temperature, humidity and gas concentrations
- The design and operation of ventilation systems, fans, ducts, regulators, doors, stoppings and other devices
- The ventilation planning and management for different types of mines, such as coal, metal, non-metal and gassy mines
- The control of dust, gas, heat, noise and radiation in mines
- The legal and environmental aspects of mine ventilation
- The use of computers and software for mine ventilation simulation and optimization

The book is well-written and illustrated with numerous examples, diagrams, tables and charts. It also includes exercises, references and appendices at the end of each chapter. The book is suitable for both undergraduate and postgraduate courses on mine ventilation as well as for self-study and professional development.

Mine ventilation is a complex and dynamic process that requires constant monitoring and adjustment. The mine ventilation engineer has to consider various factors, such as the geology, layout, production, equipment, personnel and regulations of the mine. The engineer also has to deal with the uncertainties and changes in the mine environment, such as the ventilation demand, air leakage, air quality and ventilation disturbances.
 
Mine ventilation is not only a technical challenge but also an economic and environmental one. The mine ventilation system consumes a significant amount of energy and contributes to the greenhouse gas emissions of the mining industry. The mine ventilation engineer has to optimize the ventilation system to minimize the energy consumption and environmental impact while ensuring the safety and comfort of the miners. The engineer also has to evaluate the cost-benefit analysis of different ventilation options and technologies.
 
Mine ventilation is a multidisciplinary field that involves the knowledge and skills of various branches of engineering, such as mechanical, electrical, civil, chemical and computer engineering. The mine ventilation engineer has to collaborate with other engineers, managers, operators and regulators to design, implement and maintain the ventilation system. The engineer also has to keep abreast of the latest research and developments in mine ventilation and adopt the best practices and standards in the industry.
