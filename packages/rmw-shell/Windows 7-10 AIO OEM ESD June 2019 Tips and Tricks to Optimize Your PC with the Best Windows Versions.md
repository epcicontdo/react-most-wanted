If you want to have multiple versions of Windows on one installation media, you can create a Windows 7-10 AIO (All In One) OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) ESD (Electronic Software Delivery) ISO file. This file will allow you to install Windows 7, 8.1 or 10 with a single product key and an encrypted install.esd file that reduces the size of the ISO.
