## Why Do Some Games Use AP25 Protection?
 
AP25 stands for Anti-Piracy 2.5 and it is a copy protection system that was introduced by Microsoft in 2010 to prevent the piracy of Xbox 360 games. AP25 works by checking the angle of the laser on the disc, which is different for each game. If the angle does not match the expected value, the game will not load or will display an error message.
 
AP25 was implemented to combat the piracy of Xbox 360 games that use the XGD3 format, which is a disc format that allows more data to be stored on a DVD. XGD3 games are harder to copy and burn because they require special disc types and burners. However, some hackers found a way to bypass the XGD3 protection by modifying the firmware of the Xbox 360 console or the DVD drive.
 
Microsoft responded by adding AP25 protection to some XGD3 games, such as Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, Call of Duty: Black Ops, Halo: Reach and Fable III. These games require a specific firmware version and dashboard version to work properly. If the firmware or dashboard is not updated or is modified, the AP25 check will fail and the game will not load or will display an error message.
 
## How to Update Your Xbox 360 Firmware?
 
If you want to play AP25 games on your Xbox 360 console, you need to update your firmware to the latest version. Firmware is the software that controls the hardware of your console and DVD drive. Updating your firmware can improve the performance and compatibility of your console and games.
 
There are two ways to update your Xbox 360 firmware: online and offline. Online update is the easiest and fastest way to update your firmware. You just need to connect your console to the internet and follow the instructions on the screen. Offline update is useful if you do not have an internet connection or if you have problems with online update. You need to download the update file from Microsoft's website and transfer it to your console using a USB flash drive or a CD/DVD.
