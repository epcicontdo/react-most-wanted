## How to Digitize Graphs and Plots with GetData Graph Digitizer?
 
Once you have activated the full version of GetData Graph Digitizer with your serial number, you can start digitizing graphs and plots from various sources. The process is simple and consists of four steps:

1. Open a graph image file. You can use the "File" > "Open Image" menu or drag and drop the file into the program window. The program supports various image formats, such as TIFF, JPEG, BMP, and PCX. You can also scan an image directly from a scanner or capture an image from the screen.
2. Set the scale of the graph. You need to define the coordinate system of the graph by specifying two points on each axis and their corresponding values. You can use the "Axes" > "Set Axes" menu or click on the toolbar button. The program can handle linear, logarithmic, date/time, reciprocal, latitude, and longitude axes.
3. Digitize the graph data. You can use the automatic or manual mode to extract data points from the graph. In the automatic mode, the program uses various algorithms to detect points, curves, bars, edges, centroids, skeletons, and histograms. You can adjust the parameters of each algorithm to suit your graph. In the manual mode, you can click on each data point or use a crosshair cursor to mark them. You can also edit, delete, or move data points as needed.
4. Copy or export the data. You can copy the data to the clipboard or export it to a file. The program supports various formats, such as TXT, XLS, XML, DXF, and EPS. You can also plot the data on a new graph window or save it as a project file for later use.
